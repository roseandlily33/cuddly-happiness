# Cuddly Happiness
Week #14 Challenge Full Stack Blog Application

## Description:
A full stack blog application built from scratch, using Handlebars.js, CSS, Express, Sequelize. You can create a user, login, views all of the blogs, select a blog and then read and add comments, see a dashboard of all your own blog posts, and create or edit the blog post from there. 

## Usage
Clone the reppo, in the terminal: npm install. .env file = DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME=blogs_db, SECRET. Terminal: seed the database, run npm run seed, run the server, open localhost:3001/ in browser, top right hand corner login then create a user

## What I Learned:
I learned how to use handlebars.js which I really enjoyed, and routing systems. I learned that when using bcrypt and seeding data you cannot login apparently because of the encryption. I also learned how to put the backend and the frontend together which took a minute, and the whole thing was such a big project I've spent so many hours on it and I am so happy with how it looks and how it turned out. 

## Difficulties:
The most difficult thing about this project was the routing system, but I think that I got a better understanding for it. 

## Successes:
There was a lot of successes I was able to create and do the handlebars, create the theme, and do most of the javascript, set up sequelize even though I got about 10 errors in the process and the sequelize modals. 

## Design Process
The design process started off being a blue theme (even though it was supposed to be a tech blog, that just went right over my head), and I wanted to do something with desserts, I had picked a name, decided to go with a different name - Shortcake Blogs and then that turned it into a different colours scheme of a strawberry shortcake, and I came up with a cake design to show each blog on the main page, and to have everything dessert themed.
